# Run script for the deep sea observatory
# 
# Observatory boots up and runs an event. At each event, the
# observatory will boot the DEEPi Array and power it for approximately
# 60 minutes. During that time the array will take a 720p picture
# every 10 minutes. The photos will operate off of a seperate cron
# job. The purpose of this script is to run basic checks and log
# information. A similar script will run on the individual DEEPi

# Sync time
# HACK: time sync is not working, so instead the system will skip
# forward in time at every event.

# TODO: skip forward in time

# Run status checks

# TODO: all network connections active
# TODO: check disk space

# TODO: if there is a problem what do???

# TODO: write status to log of some sort
